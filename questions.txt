001 - WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
      An object is a container for variables, it has data inside of it. It helps organize the code, and create a standard syntax.



002 - HOW DO YOU ACCESS A PROPERTY OF AN OBJECT?
      By using the syntax "nameOfVar.property", for example:
      If you have an object like this:

        var circle={
          x:0,
          y:0,
          diameter:50
          };
      and you want to access the properties inside that object, you would write:

        ellipse(circle.x, circle.y, circle.diameter, circle.diameter);
   


003 - WHAT IS THE INDEX OF THE FIRST ITEM IN AN ARRAY?
      The index of the first item in an array is 0 (zero).



004 - WHAT SYNTAX CAN YOU USE TO GET THE THIRD ITEM IN AN ARRAY?
      arrayName[2],



005 - HOW DO YOU USE A VARIABLE NAD A LOOP TO GET EVERY ITEM IN AN ARRAY?
      By using a for loop, like this:
      
        var nums = [25,50,75,100];
        
        for (var i=0; i<4; i++) {
          ellipse(10,200,nums[i],nums[i]);
        }
